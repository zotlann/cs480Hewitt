## Project Description
Apesphere is our final project that is inspired by Super Monkey Ball.

## Dependency Instructions
To run this project on Linux, installation of these three programs are required [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/), [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html), and [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Tutorials).

This project uses OpenGL 3.3. Some computers, such as virtual machines in the ECC, can not run this version. In in order to run OpenGL 2.7 follow the instructions at [Using OpenGL 2.7](https://github.com/HPC-Vis/computer-graphics/wiki/Using-OpenGL-2.7)

### Ubuntu/Linux
Assimp, Magick++, and Bullet are needed.
```bash
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglm-dev libsdl2-dev libassimp-dev libbullet-dev
```

## Build Instructions
Use make with the following commands:
```bash
mkdir build
cp makefile build
cd build
make
```

## Usage Instructions
```bash
./apesphere -c [master_config_file]
```
**EXAMPLE:**
```bash
./apesphere -c ../assets/configs/apesphere/master.xml
```
NOTE: Sometimes there is a seg fault at start, just re-run it until it runs.
